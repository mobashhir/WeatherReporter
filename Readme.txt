The program will read a text file which contains a list of zip codes and print (in sorted order of the city names) the name of the city, the 2-character state, the zip code, the forecast minimum and maximum temperature, and condition for the next 24 hours. Condition, for example, may be Sunny, partly cloudy, rainy, etc. In addition it will also print the name of the warmest city (from the maximum temperatures) and the name of the coldest city (from the minimum temperatures).

For example, if the input file were to contain the following zip codes:
77201
77204
81611

The output format may be like this, for example:

Weather data:
City			 State			Zip Code		Min		Max		Condition

Dallas		 TX					75201				61		75		Sunny
